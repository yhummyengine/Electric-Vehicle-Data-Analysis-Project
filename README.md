### Project Overview 

This Data Analysis Project details a comprehensive dashboard of BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) & PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) and their growth and usage during a specified time period

### Data Source

Electric Vehicles Dataset: The Primary Dataset used is "Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv" (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zrI6hQb27hXJzVYfffZF5_MxtXzhRHEN1bDPpfElIkA/edit?usp=sharing) containing details of BEVs and PHEVs within a set time frame


### Tools

- Excel
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating Reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading & Inspection
2. Data Wrangling
3. Data formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA was performed  to answer key questions:

- The market size and growth of BEVs and PHEVs
- Average range of Electric Vehicles
- The top N BEVs and PHEVs by model

### Result/Findings

- Model Y accounted for the highest number of vehicles manufactured
- The Average range for electric vehicles is 67.88KM

### Recommendations

- Given that ‘MODEL Y’ is the most popular electric vehicle, consider marketing campaigns or incentives to further boost its adoption.
- Highlight the benefits of ‘MODEL 3,’ ‘LEAF,’ and ‘NIRO’ to attract potential buyers.
- To encourage more people to switch to electric vehicles, invest in expanding charging infrastructure.
- Educate Consumers on Electric Range
